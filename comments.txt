In the strings.json file you can add variables that will be replaced by the real value in at the moments it's called:

Example : If you put "The song SONG_TILE is now looped" in the loopOn string the name of the song playing will replace SONG_TITLE.

List of variables depending on the string (";" is a separation between 2 variables names) :

loopOn : SONG_TITLE
loopOff : SONG_TITLE
startedPlaying : SONG_TITLE ; url
songAddedToQueue : SONG_TITLE ; url
